Subject: Add support for UEFI Secure Boot validation toggling through shim

This allows one to install third-party drivers and still have their system
work (albeit without full Secure Boot validation), automatizing the step
of disabling validation in shim.

Users still have the possibility to notice this and skip the step, thus
not disabling Secure Boot (but then, they will not be able to load the
dkms drivers that were added).
